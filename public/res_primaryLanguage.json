      "description": "Greetings and welcome to my humble portfolio! &nbsp; I am Olsen, a computer science major at the esteemed Davidson College and a soon-to-be software engineer. While I may have a strong academic background, I promise I'm not just a stuffy bookworm. I love nothing more than getting my hands dirty and building new things. In my free time, you can find me playing guitar and staying active by weightlifting. Also, as the founder and president of the Competitive Coding club at Davidson, I have also had the opportunity to lead my team to victory at various hackathons, winning over 11 prizes across 8 different events (including first place at Caltech). In addition to my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I also run a successful software contracting company with my friend Spencer Hawkins. We go by the name Hawkins and Olsen Technologies, or HOT for short, and have had a total of 4 clients with a revenue of around $10,000 from building custom software. With a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for building and creating, I believe I would be a great fit for any team. I am excited to continue growing as a programmer and leader, and I am always open to new opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me through LinkedIn or email at olsenbudanur@gmail.com.",

It is a web & mobile application that aims to solve food waste/shortage and to support communities by making our way of living more sustainable! SusEats allows local restaurants to create decentralized auctions for foods with close expiry dates that they would otherwise throw away. Then, individuals (or institutions) can bid to buy up this food through SusEats. Would you like to get a quick and cheap dinner while aiding your local restaurants? Would you like to buy up food to donate to local shelters/charities? Do you want to flip almost-expiring foods to make a quick buck? Well, look no further than SusEats! Help yourself and your community by eating SUStainably!!!",

Finding resources on smart contracts online is quite easy; however, these resources are scattered all over the web with no particular order. Spencer and Olsen (under the supervision of Dr. Mendes at Davidson College) decided to fix this problem by creating a curated, thorough, and progressive documentation of the smart contract space. In this documentation, we will take you through the most popular tools used to build and deploy smart contracts (Truffle, Ganache, Solidity), popular smart contract interfaces, and common vulnerabilities/security flaws of smart contracts. It is important to note that this documentation was written during the Spring semester of 2022 (Smart Contract Engineering Independent Study 2022), and certain chapters might be outdated. Please supplement our documentation with additional readings to stay up to date with smart contracts!",
